      "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a high-level, highly extensible, object-oriented programming language. Python is open source, cross-platform (runs on Windows / Mac OS X / Linux), immensely flexible, and extremely easy to use and learn. \n",
      "Python is an interpreted language, i.e., code is read and executed on a line-by-line basis. Some of the key features, advantages and disadvantages are listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Interpreted language\n",
      "* Clean and easy-to-read code construct \n",
      "* Intuitive syntax\n",
      "* Fewer lines of code = Fewer bugs\n",
      "* dynamically typed\n",
      "* automatic memory management\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ease of programming - minimizing the time for development, debugging and maintainence \n",
      "* Modular and object-oriented programming with a good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
      "* Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
      "* Availability of a large collection of libraries/add-on packages.\n",

      "Most linux distributions and Apple's Mac OS X come with python installed. Currently this is version 2.7. Installers for Python 3.3 are available through the package management program on these operating systems. Windows on the other hand lacks a good packaging system, so the easiest way to setup a Python environment is to install a pre-packaged distribution. \n",
      "The python software foundation distributes a python installer for all platforms and you can install that. For installing addition libraries you can use python's built-in package management system ``pip``. While this is perfectly reasonable, there is a simpler way to install python and all the commonly used python packages such as numpy and scipy via pre-packaged scientific python distributions. These pre-packaged distributions are usually cross-platform. Some of the good ones are :\n",
      "\n",
      " * [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html). Continuum Analytics' Anaconda Python is free, cross-platform and has a pretty permissive license.\n",
      " * [Python(x,y)](http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/). Fully open source and BSD license and Windows only. Currently supports only Python 2.x\n",
      " * [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php). EPD is a cross-platform commercial product but is available free for academic use and has a free version that contains a limited set of libraries.\n",
      "\n",

It\u2019s free, quite simple to use, supports python 3, and includes all the libraries needed for scientific computin, and includes the awesome conda package manager that makes installing additional packages and managing virtual development environments really easy. It also comes with Spyder, a really neat IDE. Grab the Python 3.x installer from http://continuum.io/downloads, double click and follow the instructions. More install instructions and documentation is available at http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Note on installation in Windows\n",
      "On Windows, if you are installing Anaconda for just yourself, it gets installed in the `AppData` folder in your HOME folder `(C:\\Users\\<username>)`. Personally I do not prefer this install location. I prefer to create a directory `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Software` and install all my personal software there. If you change the installation path during the install process to `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Software\\Anaconda`, anaconda will be installed there. The installer creates the folder if it is not there. You can also install it in any other directory that you want."
